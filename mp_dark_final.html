				<h1>
				Overview
				</h1>
				<p>
				The final entry to the famous Dark-series.
				A complex map in gameplay despite the modest appearance.
				A throwback to simpler times, when map making was all about jumps and design was left second.
				</p>
				<a id="hard1" class="picture"></a>
				<h1>
				Background
				</h1>
				<p>
				This map was originally started in 2015 by <b>kie</b> with the help of <b>fre4kZ</b> and the goal was to create a truly <i>revolutionary</i> map in terms of gameplay.
				Even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvJFKFdiJw" target="_blank">teaser trailer</a> was made for it by <b>fre4kZ</b> where the map looked well on its way, but for the lack of true motivation and with the increasing expectation from the community the map was ultimately left unfinished.
				</p>
				<p>
				As <b>fre4kZ</b> would later go onto detail about, he and some of the testers weren't really happy with how the map played, which in large part was supposed to be its highlight and considering how iconic the series had been so far, anything but perfect wasn't going to suffice.
				During the following years the map faded into obscurity, many still hoping it would be released some day, but the final nail in the coffin was when the main mapper of the project <b>kie</b> lost the project files for the map sometime after 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
				Five years later, in 2020 <b>Toxic</b> expressed interest in wanting to finish this map as significant progress had been made towards <a href="https://xoxor4d.github.io/projects/iw3xo/" target="_blank">tools which could export project files from a pre-compiled map</a>.
				And as we still had a compiled version of the unfinished map, we used these tools to get back the project files with the permission of <b>kie</b>.
				</p>
				<a id="easy_hard2" class="picture"></a>
				<h1>
				Visuals
				</h1>
				<p>
				The visual design of the Dark-series has always been quite primitive as the focus was more on the gameplay.
				However, the visual style still has a strong nostalgia factor as many players learned the game through these old Dark maps.
				Because we didn't want to take away from that aspect, we decided to follow <b>kie</b>'s original vision and not make any significant changes to the established formula.
				</p>
				<a id="hard2" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The visual style itself is a simple platform map set at night, with industrial textures and moody lighting.
				The areas are built in such a way where they include many aspects of the aesthetic known as <i>liminal spaces</i>.
				Some areas are more structured, clean rooms with very few floating objects, whereas other areas are very open and therefore chaotic to the point that only a small portion of the playable space is filled with collidable objects.
				This introduces a lot of contrast between the structured and open areas, giving the map a sort of unnatural and unsettling feeling.
				</p>
				<a id="easy1" class="picture"></a>
				<h1>
				Gameplay
				</h1>
				<p>
				The gameplay on the original Dark maps was groundbreaking, especially on v1 and v3.
				Both maps introduced new things to the game and arguably evolved the meta more than any other map.
				This map originally had the same goal, but the focus started to quickly shift from making a revolutionary map into making a non-frustrating map.
				CoDJumper at this time was already over a decade old mod, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to come up with new things that were hard in a non-frustrating way.
				New ideas quickly became straight up annoying, so it was a huge challenge trying to find ways to alleviate that frustration without making things too easy.
				</p>
				<p>
				The map has a total of six routes, half of them being original routes and the other half being remakes.
				As the map is sort of a throwback to old players, it is intentionally designed to be scaled a bit higher in difficulty, the hard route being almost unplayble for the majority of people.
				The map does have content for beginners as well, but doesn't offer the same variety as the harder routes do.
				</p>
				<a id="spawn1" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Easy route is quite standard among easy routes and doesn't stand out in any specific way.
				Offers a nice variety of jumps with a consistent difficulty.
				Great route for players who have just gotten used to FPS-switching.
				</p>
				<a id="easy2" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Easy-Hard route is basically an intermediate route despite the confusing name.
				It consists of two parts with varying jumps.
				Just like the Easy way it's consistent in its difficulty.
				Aimed at intermediate level players.
				</p>
				<a id="easy_hard1" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Hard route is the highlight of the map and where most of the effort has gone into.
				It is currently the second hardest linear codjumper route in the whole game, and therefore requires an insane level of effort in order to be finished.
				Only a handful of people have completed the route from start to finish.
				</p>
				<a id="hard3" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Dark Remake is a harder version of the original mp_dark hard way.
				Designed as a nostalgia trip, this route should bring a nice challenge for even more experienced players.
				</p>
				<a id="dark_remake1" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Dark 2 Remake is a redesigned version of the mp_dark_v2 hard way.
				The original map in its entirety was always a bit confusing for a Dark map, because the design was such a departure from the original.
				This remake reimagines the hard route with the more commonly known Dark design from v1 and v3.
				Gameplay-wise the route requires a bit more precision as the platforms have been made smaller, but other than that the difficulty is not that much harder compared to the original.
				</p>
				<a id="dark2_remake1" class="picture"></a>
				<p>
				The Dark 3 Remake is more of a remaster, since from the outside its nearly identical to the original map.
				It's meant to be a more balanced version of the original, therefore more consistent and enjoyable.
				</p>

				Credits
				</h1>
				<p>
				This map was originally started by <b>kie</b>, but a big reason why it exists today is because of <b>Toxic</b> and his interest in wanting to finish this map.
				My role started out as helping <b>Toxic</b> with a wide range of things, but evolved quickly into doing significant and meaningful parts of the map.
				It is worth to highlight though that while the map is credited to the three of us seemingly equally, <b>Toxic</b> was the main driving force behind this map.
				</p>
				<p>
				We also received some mapping help from <b>Skazy</b> as we were preparing the map for a walkthrough.
				I was supposed to make those changes myself, but unfortunately I had a sudden PC problem which restricted my mapping ability.
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally we had many testers during the mapping process who helped us test the map as well as iron out a number of different issues.
				Those people include but are not limited to <b>Sardonyx</b>, <b>NoobAim</b>, <b>Skazy</b>, <b>Trickshot</b> and <b>Treaxer</b>.
